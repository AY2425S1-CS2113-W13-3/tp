* The list shown varies based on the value of `TYPE` entered, as follows:
  * A list of participants is shown when `TYPE` is `participant`.

* `mark -e Origami workshop -s undone` marks the event `Origami workshop` as not done.

### Marks a participant as present: `mark`

Marks a participant for an event as present or absent.

Examples:

* `copy Origami workshop > Coding workshop` copies the participant list from the `Origami workshop` event to the `Coding workshop` event.

### Find participant: `find`

Finds all participants with a specified name in a specified event.

Format: `find -e EVENT -p NAME`

* The `NAME` keywords are case-insensitive.

Examples:
* `find -e Origami workshop -p john` will output all participants with `john` in their name in the event `Origami workshop`.

### Filters event list: `filter`

Filters out events from the event list based on name, date-time or priority level.

Format: `filter -e/-t/-u DESCRIPTION`

* `-e/-t/-u` are the flags for name, date-time and priority level respectively.
