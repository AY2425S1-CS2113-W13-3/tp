# User Guide

## Introduction

EventManager CLI is a CLI application that allows organisers of small-scale events to track
the participants and logistics of such events.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 17 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of `EventManagerCLI` from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-3/tp/releases).
3. Open a new terminal in the folder that you put the JAR file in, and run the program with the command ```java -jar EventManagerCLI.jar```.
The following message would be printed:

### View all participants or items for an event: `view`

Shows a list of all participants or items for an event.

Format: `view -e EVENT -y TYPE`

* The list shown varies based on the value of `TYPE` entered, as follows:
  * A list of participants is shown when `TYPE` is `participant`.
  * A list of items is shown when `TYPE` is `item`.
* `TYPE` is case-insensitive, i.e. `PARTICIPANT` and `participant` will produce the same result.

Examples:

* `view -e Origami workshop -y participant` shows a list of all participants for the event `Origami workshop`.
* `view -e Origami workshop -y item` shows a list of all items for the event `Origami workshop`. 

### Mark an event as done: `mark`

Marks an event in the event list as done or not done.

Format: `mark -e EVENT -s STATUS`

* The status parameter must be either `done` (to mark done) or `undone` (to mark not done).

Examples:

* `mark -e Origami workshop -s done` marks the event `Origami workshop` as done.
* `mark -e Origami workshop -s undone` marks the event `Origami workshop` as not done.

### Marks a participant as present: `mark`

Marks a participant for an event as present or absent.

Format: `mark -p PARTICIPANT -e EVENT -s STATUS`

* The status parameter must be either `present` (to mark present) or `absent` (to mark absent).

Examples:

* `mark -p John Tan -e Origami workshop -s done` marks the participant `John Tan` in the `Origami workshop` event as present.
* `mark -p John Tan -e Origami workshop -s undone` marks the participant `John Tan` in the `Origami workshop` event as absent.

### Marks an item as accounted for: `mark`

Marks an item for an event as accounted for or unaccounted for.

Format: `mark -m ITEM -e EVENT -s STATUS`

* The status parameter must be either `accounted` (to mark accounted) or `unaccounted` (to mark unaccounted).

Examples:

* `mark -m Origami paper -e Origami workshop -s done` marks the item `Origami paper` in the `Origami workshop` event as accounted.
* `mark -m Origami paper -e Origami workshop -s undone` marks the item `Origami paper` in the `Origami workshop` event as unaccounted.
* 
### Copies participant list: `copy`

Copies the participant list from one event to another event.

Format: `copy FROM_EVENT > TO_EVENT`

* Both events must already exist

Examples:

* `copy Origami workshop > Coding workshop` copies the participant list from the `Origami workshop` event to the `Coding workshop` event.

### Sorts event list: `sort`

Sorts events according to event name, event date-time or event priority level.

Format: `sort -by KEYWORD`

* `KEYWORD` is case-insensitive, but must be one of these inputs: `name/time/priority`

Examples:
* `sort -by name` will output a list of all the user's events alphabetically (from A to Z).
* `sort -by time` will output a list of all the user's events chronologically (earliest to latest).
* `sort -by priority` will output a list of all the user's events in terms of urgency (most to least important).

### Filters event list: `filter`

Filters out events from the event list based on name, date-time or priority level.

Format: `filter -e/-t/-u DESCRIPTION`

* `-e/-t/-u` are the flags for name, date-time and priority level respectively.
* `DESCRIPTION` is only case-insensitive when filtering using the priority level flag.

Examples:
* `filter -e workshop` will output all events with `workshop` in their event name.
* `filter -t 2024` will output all events that are occurring in `2024`.
* `filter -u high` with output all events with priority level `HIGH`.

### Find participant: `find`

Finds all participants with a specified name in a specified event.

Format: `find -e EVENT -p NAME`

* The `NAME` keywords are case-insensitive.

Examples:
* `find -e Origami workshop -p john` will output all participants with `john` in their name in the event `Origami workshop`.

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving of program data

The program saves its stored data into three `.csv` files in the same directory as the application `.JAR`.

These files are as follows:

* `events.csv`, which stores data on the `Event`s stored in the program,
* `participants.csv`, which stores data on the `Participant`s for all `Event`s,
* `items.csv`, which stores data on the `Item`s for all `Event`s,

The data is saved after the execution of every command and upon program startup.

### Loading of program data

The saved program data in the aforementioned three files is loaded into the program upon program startup.

If any one of the files do not exist in the directory, the file will be created when the data is saved.

### Editing of saved program data

Experienced users may feel free to edit the saved data in the `.csv` files.

The program data is stored in the following format:

For `events.csv`:

```
EVENT,TIME,VENUE,PRIORITY,STATUS
```

* `TIME` must be in the format `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm`.
* `PRIORITY` must be either `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, or `LOW`.
* `STATUS` must be either `Y` or `N`

For `participants.csv`:

```
PARTICIPANT,NUMBER,EMAIL,STATUS,EVENT
```

* `STATUS` must be either `Y` or `N`
* An entry for the `Event` corresponding to `EVENT` must be present in `events.csv`.

For `items.csv`:

```
ITEM,STATUS,EVENT
```

* `STATUS` must be either `Y` or `N`
* An entry for the `Event` corresponding to `EVENT` must be present in `events.csv`.

All fields added to the `.csv` files must also be enclosed within double quotation marks (`" "`) to be properly parsed.

If the above format or parameter constraints are not followed, the `Event`, `Participant` or `Item` corresponding to the file line will not be loaded upon program startup.
