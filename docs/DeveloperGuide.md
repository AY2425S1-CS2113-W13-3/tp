## Design

<img src = "images/ArchitectureDiagram.png">

The *Architecture Diagram* given above provides the high-level design of the application.

### Main components

The application comprises the following components:
* `Main`, which handles program startup and shutdown, and also interactions between other components.
* `UI`, which handles user input and showing messages to the user.
* `Storage`, which handles the loading and saving of data upon program startup and shutdown.
* `Parser`, which converts user input into commands.
* `Command`, which are executed to modify the data stored in the program.
* `EventList`, which stores the program's data.

### Interactions between components

The above *Sequence Diagram* shows how the different components of the system interact with one
another in the scenario when the command `add -e event -t 1200 -v venue` is executed.


## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### List feature[TBD]

The `list` feature allows users to view all scheduled events in the system. 
It is implemented in the `ListCommand` class, which extends the base `Command` class and formats the output to display all events. 
Internally, the `list` operation does not modify any data but simply retrieves and displays the information from `EventList`.

The `ListCommand` class performs the following key operations:

* ListCommand#execute() â€” Generates a formatted message displaying all events in the list.

These operations are accessible through the `Command` and can be invoked when the list command is entered by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and the behavior of the list feature at each step:

1. User Command Input:
The user enters the command `list` to view all scheduled events.

2. Command Recognition:
The `COMMAND_WORD` is set to "list", enabling the system to recognize the command input and invoke `ListCommand`.

3. Execution of ListCommand#execute():
The `execute()` method retrieves each event from `eventList` and appends it to a formatted output message.
It uses the `String.format` method with `LIST_MESSAGE` to include the total number of events in the message header.
Events are appended to `outputMessage` with numbered formatting for readability.

4. Output Generation:
The method stores the generated `outputMessage` in `this.message`, ready for display.

### Mark/unmark feature

The mark/unmark feature allows users to mark events as done or not done. The feature comprises `MarkEventCommand`, which 
extends `Command`. This class performs one operation, which marks a specified event as done or not done.

The above operation is implemented as `MarkEventCommand#execute()`. This then overrides the `Command#execute()` operation in `Command`,
and is invoked when the latter operation is called.

#### Feature implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario for the mark/unmark mechanism, and how it behaves at each step.

1. The user adds an event `Event 1` to the event list. The mark status for `Event 1` is initially `false` or not done.

2. The user enters the command `mark -e Event 1 -s done` to mark `Event 1` as done. The `MarkEventCommand` calls `MarkEventCommand#execute`,
in which it gets the event `Event 1` from the event list, and sets its mark status to `true` or done.

3. The user then enters the command `mark -e Event 1 -s undone` to mark `Event 1` as not done. The `MarkEventCommand` again calls `MarkEventCommand#execute`,
in which it gets the event `Event 1` from the event list, and sets its mark status to `false` or not done.

The interactions between components during the execution of the `mark` command are show in the **Sequence Diagram** below:

## Product scope
### Target user profile

The target user:
* has a need to organise a large number of events
* organises small-scale events, such that he is able to handle all matters on his own
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is comfortable using a command-line interface

### Value proposition

The user is able to organise and manage his events more quickly and efficiently than with a mouse/GUI app
