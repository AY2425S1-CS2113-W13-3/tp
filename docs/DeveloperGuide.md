## Design

<img src = "images/ArchitectureDiagram.png">

The above **Architecture Diagram** provides the high-level design of the application.

### Main components

The application comprises the following components:

* `Main`, which handles program startup and shutdown, and also interactions between other components.
* `UI`, which handles user input and showing messages to the user.
* `Storage`, which handles the loading and saving of data upon program startup and shutdown.
* `Parser`, which converts user input into commands.
* `Command`, which are executed to modify the data stored in the program.
* `Event`, which stores the program's data.

### Interactions between components

<img src = "images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png">

The above **Sequence Diagram** shows how the different components of the system interact with one
another in the scenario when the command `add -e event -t 1200 -v venue` is executed.

### UI component

<img src = "images/UiClassDiagram.png">

The `UI` component comprises an Ui class, as shown in the above **Class Diagram**.

The `UI` does the following:

* Take in command input from the user and pass the input to `Main`.
* Show output messages from `Command` to the user after command execution.

### Command component

The `Command` component and its component classes are shown in the below **Class Diagram**:

<img src = "images/CommandClassDiagram.png">

The `Command` component does the following:

* Handle the execution of the user command through interactions with `Event`.
* Provides a command output message to `Ui` after the command execution.

The interactions between `Command` and other commands in the system is shown in the following _Sequence Diagram_:

### Event component

The `Event` component and its component classes are shown in the below **Class Diagram**:

<img src = "images/EventClassDiagram.png">

The `Event` component does the following:
* Handle the addition, removal and marking of events stored in `EventList`.
* Add, remove and mark participants for a specific `Event` in `EventList`.

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### List feature[TBD]

The `list` feature allows users to view all scheduled events in the system. 
It is implemented in the `ListCommand` class, which extends the base `Command` class and formats the output to display all events. 
Internally, the `list` operation does not modify any data but simply retrieves and displays the information from `EventList`.

The `ListCommand` class performs the following key operations:

* ListCommand#execute() â€” Generates a formatted message displaying all events in the list.

These operations are accessible through the `Command` and can be invoked when the list command is entered by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and the behavior of the list feature at each step:

1. User Command Input:
The user enters the command `list` to view all scheduled events.

2. Command Recognition:
The `COMMAND_WORD` is set to "list", enabling the system to recognize the command input and invoke `ListCommand`.

3. Execution of ListCommand#execute():
The `execute()` method retrieves each event from `eventList` and appends it to a formatted output message.
It uses the `String.format` method with `LIST_MESSAGE` to include the total number of events in the message header.
Events are appended to `outputMessage` with numbered formatting for readability.

4. Output Generation:
The method stores the generated `outputMessage` in `this.message`, ready for display.


## Product scope
### Target user profile

The target user:

* has a need to organise a large number of events
* organises small-scale events, such that he is able to handle all matters on his own
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is comfortable using a command-line interface

### Value proposition

The user is able to organise and manage his events more quickly and efficiently than with a mouse/GUI app
